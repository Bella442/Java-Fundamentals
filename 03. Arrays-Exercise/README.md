1.	Train
You will be given a count of wagons in a train n. On the next n lines, you will receive how many people are going to get on that wagon. At the end print the whole train and after that the sum of the people in the train.

2.	Common Elements
Write a program, which prints common elements in two arrays. You have to compare the elements of the second array to the elements of the first.

3.	Zig-Zag Arrays
Write a program which creates 2 arrays. You will be given an integer n. On the next n lines, you get 2 integers. Form 2 arrays as shown below.

4.	Array Rotation
Write a program that receives an array and number of rotations you have to perform (first element goes at the end) Print the resulting array.

5.	Top Integers
Write a program to find all the top integers in an array. A top integer is an integer which is bigger than all the elements to its right. 

6.	Equal Sums
Write a program that determines if there exists an element in the array such that the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right.
If there are no elements to the left / right, their sum is considered to be 0. Print the index that satisfies the required condition or “no” if there is no such index.

7.  Max Sequence of Equal Elements
Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal elements in an array of integers. If several longest sequences exist, print the leftmost one.

8.	Magic Sum
Write a program, which prints all unique pairs in an array of integers whose sum is equal to a given number.
