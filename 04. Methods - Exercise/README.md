1.	Smallest of Three Numbers
Write a method to print the smallest of three integer numbers. Use appropriate name for the method.

2.	Vowels Count
Write a method that receives a single string and prints the count of the vowels. Use appropriate name for the method.

3.	Characters in Range
Write a method that receives two characters and prints on a single line all the characters in between them according to ASCII.

4.	Password Validator
Write a program that checks if a given password is valid. Password rules are:
•	6 – 10 characters (inclusive);
•	Consists only of letters and digits;
•	Have at least 2 digits.
If a password is valid, print "Password is valid". If it is not valid, for every unfulfilled rule print a message:
•	"Password must be between 6 and 10 characters";
•	"Password must consist only of letters and digits";
•	"Password must have at least 2 digits".

5.	Add and Subtract
You will receive 3 integers. Write a method sum to get the sum of the first two integers and subtract method that subtracts the third integer from the result from the sum method. 

6.	Middle Characters
You will receive a single string. Write a method that prints the middle character. If the length of the string is even, there are two middle characters.

7.	NxN Matrix
Write a method that receives a single integer n and prints nxn matrix with that number.

8.	Factorial Division
Read two integer numbers. Calculate factorial of each number. Divide the first result by the second and print the division formatted to the second decimal point.

9.	Palindrome Integers
A palindrome is a number which reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a program which reads a positive integer numbers until you receive "END". For each number print whether the number is palindrome or not.

10.	Top Number
Read an integer n from the console. Find all top numbers in the range [1 … n] and print them. A top number holds the following properties:
•	Its sum of digits is divisible by 8, e.g. 8, 16, 88.
•	Holds at least one odd digit, e.g. 232, 707, 87578.
